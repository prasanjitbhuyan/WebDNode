Model - The domain-specific representation of the information on which the application operates. The model is another name for the domain layer. Domain logic adds meaning to raw data (e.g., calculating if today is the userâ€™s birthday, or the totals, taxes and shipping charges for shopping cart items).
View - Renders the model into a form suitable for interaction, typically a user interface element. MVC is often seen in web applications, where the view is the HTML page and the code which gathers dynamic data for the page.
Controller - Processes and responds to events, typically user actions, and invokes changes on the model and perhaps the view.
